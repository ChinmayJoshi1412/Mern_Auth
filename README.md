# Mern Auth
This project is a mini web application designed to demonstrate user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and state management with Redux Toolkit. It leverages the MERN stack, incorporating 
React.js for building the dynamic and interactive user interface, 
Redux Toolkit for managing the application's global state, ensuring seamless data flow, 
Express.js for creating the backend REST API and 
MongoDB for database management, storing user credentials securely.
